The source code for R-ODAFâ€™s DEG analysis can be found on GitHub (https://github.com/R-ODAF/Main/blob/main/scripts/R_ODAF_DEGs.R).

The General pipeline can be seen here in Figure 1. I conducted a differential expression analysis using the R-ODAF pipeline, then used the differentially expressed genes as input for the BMD analysis. For the BMD analysis, I did not perform William's trend test to identify differentially expressed genes, because I use the R-ODAF `DESeq2::DESeq()` function to identify DEGs instead... the purpose of doing so was to facilitate a discussion of the differentially expressed genes from the R-ODAF pipeline and enriched gene sets from the R-ODAF pipeline. Since the R-ODAF DEG pipeline is less sensitive, it is less likely that DEGs are false-positive results. Thus, I can have more confidence in discussing enriched gene sets and differentially expressed genes identified from this analysis without worrying about false-positives. I reiterate that, the purpose of this section is to facilitate a discussion and not to identify points of departure, although it is possible to calculate tPODs using this method (which I have included below). One of the issues with calculating a tPOD from the R-ODAF DEG method is that it is less sensitive and thus I excluded this tPOD derivation method from the main body of my thesis and this section will end up in the supplementarty information.

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("Plots/R-ODAF_DEGs/Slide1.jpg")
```
 Again to reiterate, I followed the R-ODAF pipeline all the way down to the Differential Expresion analysis part of the pipeline. I then used the table of differentially expressed genes in the benchmark dose analysis. I did not filter the DEGs with William's trend test of a fold-change filter since DEGs have already been identified using the `DESeq2::DESeq()` function. I did however, keep the remaining filtering criteria downstream of the William's trend test and fold-change filter.

Following normalization and the â€˜relevanceâ€™ filter, the DESeq2 R package was used to identify differentially expressed genes via the `DESeq2::DESeq()` function which applies Negative Binomial Generalized Linear Model (GLM) fitting and the Wald test for the GLM coefficients (Love et al., 2014). The model fit p-values were adjusted for multiple testing via the FDR adjustment (É‘ = 0.01). Genes with adjusted p-values greater than 0.01 were removed. 
Furthermore, a spurious spike in expression filter was applied.

Spurious Spike Threshold =1.4 (# of biological replicates)-0.66 

If any samples exceeded the spurious spike threshold for a gene, the gene was removed. This function excludes genes with replicates representing more than 66% of the total read counts (with triplicate biological replicates). Spurious spikes in expression are defined as a single sample representing the majority of reads of a dose for a gene (Verheijen et al., 2022). Finally, a 3rd quartile rule filter was applied. It is common for DEG analyses to apply a fold-change filter. However, a fold-change filter can lead to the exclusion of genes that are differentially expressed, but have low expression levels. To replace the fold-change filter, the 3rd quartile rule can be used to remove genes from the gene list for which the median of a dose group is not higher than the 3rd quartile of the control group (Verheijen et al., 2022). The list of unique genes from all dose group comparisons (5 comparisons: three controls vs three dose 5, three control vs three dose 1) remaining after the before mentioned filters were considered DEGs responsive to treatment. Figure 2 shows the number of DEGs per chemical, grouped by dose, in a bar plot. The bar plots showing the number of DEGs in each dose group were made o to ensure that DEGs were dose-responseive and monotonic (Figure 2).

```{r}
#Plot
multiplot(plotlist = p_list,
          layout = matrix(
            c(1:length(p_list), NA, NA),
            nrow = 3,
            ncol = 3,
            byrow = TRUE
          ))
```
